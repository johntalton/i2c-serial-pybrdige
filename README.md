# I²C to Serial Bridge

A bridge layer for CircuitPython devices (PR240 Adafruit Feather .. etc) between a WebSerial layer and the I²C low-lever command controls.

## Inspired by

The Excamera I2CDriver (and I2CDriverMini) are a similar device that bridge the bus layers, allowing for capture modes and visualizations.
